# Changelog

The kit is versioned by date: `YYYY.MM.N`, where `N` counts the releases in that month from 0.

## 2026.10.0

The first release. Built on Laravel 13 and LarawellUI 0.2.1.

### Pages

- Home page linking to every page; pages behind sign in ask for it, then go straight there.
- Sign in, create account, forgot and reset password, email verification, and password confirmation.
- Dashboard with your own sign-in history in a sortable, paginated table that turns into cards on phones, and a warning after recent wrong passwords.
- Settings: profile, password, signing out other devices, and deleting the account.
- Light, dark and system theme, remembered in the browser and applied before the page is drawn.
- Every page fits screens from 320px wide.

### Security

- Every setting in `config/security.php`, each explained; `SECURITY.md` has a go-live checklist and what to change for Stripe, analytics, embedding or Livewire.
- Content Security Policy with a fresh nonce on every request, plus clickjacking, MIME-sniffing, referrer and HSTS headers.
- Sign-in, sign-up, password reset and confirmation rate limited; registration can be turned off.
- New passwords need 12 characters and, in production, mustn't appear in known data breaches.
- Changing the email asks for the password again; changing the password signs out every other session.
- Encrypted sessions, HTTPS-only cookies and HTTPS links in production.
- The demo account is only ever created on your own machine.
- CI runs the tests, Pint, `composer audit` and `npm audit`; Dependabot keeps dependencies current.

### AI agents

- Laravel Boost and LarawellUI's MCP server set up for Claude Code and Codex, with guidelines for the kit's rules and a careful working style in `.ai/guidelines/`.
